#Vuelta in Breda Responsive Website

In this project I used the skills I learnt to build a mobile-first responsive website to inform people about La Vuelta a España in Breda. The third biggest cycling race in the world will start in Holland in 2020. 
What does it do and what need does it fulfil?
The website fulfils the need for fans and potential visitors to find information about the route, the city of Breda, La Vuelta and in time the riders and teams. 
It shows the way people can come to Breda (train, car, bike), where the start and finish of the stage is, what route it will follow and there is some background information about tourist attractions in Breda and a bit of history about La Vuelta. This all is visually supported with photos and a video.
The website should be easy in use. I visit races myself and it’s always quite a struggle to find all the information I would like. This site will provide it all within a  few clicks.

##2User Stories

*Someone from Groningen would like to know how to come to Breda by train and can find that information by going to the ‘Hoe kom je in Breda?’ (How to get to Breda) page.
*Someone from Rotterdam would like to know what to do in Breda besides watching La Vuelta and finds what he is looking for on the ‘Breda biedt meer’ (Breda offers more) page.
*Someone from Breda would like to do some volunteer-work during La Vuelta and can sign up using the Contact page.
*Someone from Tilburg who doesn’t know that much about cycling can find more information about La Vuelta on ‘La Vuelta 2020’ page

##Functionality and Features

The website is fully responsive, on desktop and larger screen sizes the header-photo is different from mobile and tablet and there are extra links to social media in the header.
The navigation is functional and there is one form (for those who want to volunteer during the race) thankyou page. These forms are not fully functional in that they don't alert anyone from the Webteam that a form has being filled nor do they fill a database. 
The links to Facebook, Instagram, Youtube and Twitter are links to the official pages of ‘La Vuelta Holanda’. La Vuelta will be in Holland for three days, starting in Utrecht, going to Den Bosch on the second day and Breda on the third. 

##Features Left to Implement

*Social Media – The site now links to the social pages of ‘La Vuelta Holanda’. La Vuelta Breda could also have its own social pages.
*Startlist – Not all the information about the Vuelta in 2020 is public yet. Over the next period more will be known about the route and the teams starting. When made public there will be a complete and easy to use/print startlist on the site. 
*Experience – It would be nice to add a few video’s with people telling what they like about Breda. 
*‘Best places to watch’ - Once the route is more detailed I would to add ‘Best places to watch’. Places along the route where the riders will pass more than once, places where it’s easy to park your car close to the route and even make a route that makes it possible to see the riders pass on as many locations as possible. 
*English version – Since the Vuelta will also attract  people from outside Holland, it would be better to also have an English version.

##Technologies Used

*HTML5
*CSS3
*Bootstrap 4.3.1
*Font Awesome 5.3.1
*Bash
*GIT
*GITHUB
*Google Chrome developer tools
*Cloud 9 IDE
*Javascript and JQuery
*Youtube (embedded content)
*Google Maps (embedded content)

##Deployment

Website was coded in Cloud 9 IDE, a local GIT directory was used for version control and then uploaded to GITHUB using Bash script. Once in  GITHUB repositories it was made live using GITHUB Pages. The website can be found at: http://peterlenting.github.io/my-first-website/index.html
For next projects I would like to make the repositories less cluttered and more clear. But since I’ve been trying out a lot of new things during the making of this project, I pushed a lot, just to have back-ups. Next projects should be more structured. 

##Testing

Each page was tested locally and on GITHUB pages using Chrome developer tools, testing its functionality and the look and feel (landscape and portrait mode) on Galaxy S5, Pixel 2, Pixel 2XL, iPhone 6,7,8, iPhone 6,7,8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad, iPad Pro and responsive desktop. All links were tested along with the video player.
The form is not functional yet. A required attribute is added to the name, woonplaats, email and projectsummary field.

##What changed after user design experience (UDX) phase

I made wireframes, but after building the site, I didn’t like it. It looked a bit old-fashioned, so I decided to try and make the site feel more ‘2020’. This meant bigger photos and more spacing. Furthermore I diched the red and yellow colours of the Spanish flag I intended to use, because the colours where to prominent.

##Credits

**Code**
I used Bootstrap to make the Dropdownmenu, the Form and the Grid System. Futhermore I googled a lot and found a lot of information on w3schools. The other code I wrote myself.
**Content**
The content on this website was written by me. 
**Media**
*All photos were taken by me.
*The video and the map of the route are provided by the Vuelta-organisation.
